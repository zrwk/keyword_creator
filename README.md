# keyword_creator
 Creates keywords from text documents
 
1) This script extract individual words from the unformatted text document.
3) Place this script in the same directory as that password text document. 
4) Run this script in a command line. The only argument should be the name of the text document. 
5) This script will use regex to remove all unrequired text from the document, and place each keyword on a new line. 
6) The output text document will keep the original filename, with "cleaned - " prefixed, so you know where the results are from.
